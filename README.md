## Hey there! 👋  
I'm Mariano, a Computer Science student based in Chile.  

I build anything that seems interesting to me.  

If an idea comes to mind and it has value, I build it and deliver it.  

My main tech stack is Python/Django, C#/.NET, and SQL. For design, I use Figma, and for documentation, Notion.  

I have two main projects, but my favorite is a Learning Management System (the repo is private).  

I've built over 3 projects privately.  

Fun facts:  
* I have a cat  
* I like Minecraft and COD  
* **Hobbies**: gym, padel, going to church
